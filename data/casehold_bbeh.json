A preexisting condition cannot be considered in the determination of a claimant’s loss of earning capacity.

Finally, we note that Nebraska’s workers’ compensation statutes do not prohibit a claimant from concurrently receiving statutory benefits for separate injuries arising out of separate accidents, so long as the combined payments do not exceed the maximum weekly rate allowed by statute.

Thus, contrary to Vester’s contention on appeal, the United States Supreme Court has made a clear distinction between “uncounseled” convictions, and those that were secured with “ineffective” counsel. Accordingly, Yester’s claim that his “ineffective counsel” amounted to “no counsel,” for purposes of the Sixth Amendment and collateral attack on his prior convictions, must fail.
