    "question": "Context: This review indicates that the statements in Sheehan and People Who Care that an expert's failure to consider variables other than the salient characteristic renders his opinions inadmissible are outliers. HN26 There are some common themes in the cases: statistics play an important role in a plaintiffs' ability to make a prima facie case of pattern-or-practice discrimination; experts should carefully formulate their initial hypotheses; experts should consider variables other than the salient characteristic and their failure to do so weakens and renders less probative their conclusions. But particularly when plaintiffs have other evidence (such as individual testimony about personal experiences of discrimination), the weight of decision seems to treat failure to consider other variables as a factor going to the weight of the statistical evidence and not as a factor that renders the evidence inadmissible. The court concludes that Neumark's failure to follow what the Seventh Circuit appears to deem \"best practices\" by failing to consider variables other than the salient factor of race does not render his opinions so unreliable that the statistical evidence is irrelevant [*132] on that basis alone. The court concludes that if the only flaw in Neumark's methodology had been his failure to account for variables other than race, the evidence would have been relevant to the plaintiffs' allegations that Infosys discriminated under Rule 401's \"liberal,\" basic standard of relevance, Daubert, 509 U.S. at 587, and the defendants' criticisms would go to the probative value, or weight, that the trier of fact should give that evidence.16 Question: Based on the excerpt above, did the judge's legal reasoning rely on statistical evidence (e.g., regression analysis) when determining whether there was a causal link? Answer Yes or No.",

    "question": "Context: A statistical study is not inadmissible merely because it is unable to exclude all possible causal factors other than the one of interest. But a statistical study that fails to correct for salient explanatory variables, or even to make the most elementary comparisons, has no value as causal explanation and [*538] is therefore inadmissible in a federal court. The idea that the educational deficiencies of minority students in the Rockford public schools are due primarily to discrimination by the school authorities and can be rectified by an equitable decree is at once unsubstantiated by responsible evidence and--since there is no evidence that these deficiencies are any greater than in school districts around the country that have not been held to have discriminated against minority students-- implausible. Tracking might be adopted in order to segregate the races. The well-known correlation between race and academic performance makes tracking, even when implemented in accordance with strictly objective criteria, a pretty effective segregator. If tracking were adopted for this purpose, then enjoining tracking would be a proper as well as the natural remedy for this form of intentional discrimination, at least if there were no compelling evidence that it improves the academic performance of minority children and if the possible benefits to the better students and the social interest [**28] in retaining them in the public schools were given little weight. The general view is that tracking does not benefit minority students, Daniel U. Levine & Rayna F. Levine, Society and Education 38-41 (9th ed. 1996), although there is evidence that some of them do benefit. Adam Gamoran & Robert D. Mare, \"Secondary School Tracking and Educational Inequality: Compensation, Reinforcement, or Neutrality?\" 94 Am. J. Sociology 1146, 1177 (1989). All this is neither here nor there. The plaintiffs' argument is not that the school district adopted tracking way back when in order to segregate the schools. It is that it misused tracking, twisting the criteria to achieve greater segregation than objective tracking alone would have done. See 851 F. Supp. at 913-14. The school district should be enjoined from doing this--not, on this record, enjoined from tracking.

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993), governing the admissibility of expert testimony, which requires the district judge to satisfy himself that the expert is being as careful as he would be in his regular professional work outside his paid litigation consulting. E.g., Braun v. Lorillard Inc., 84 F.3d 230, 234-35 (7th Cir. 1996); Rosen v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., 78 F.3d 316, 318 (7th Cir. 1996); Daubert v.

Although the expert used standard statistical methods for determining whether there was a significant correlation between age and retention for the 17 persons on the list, see Michael O. Finkelstein & Bruce Levin, Statistics for Lawyers 157 (1990) (Fisher's exact test), the omission of Sebring and Shulman from the sample tested was arbitrary. The expert should at least have indicated the sensitivity of his analysis to these omissions. More important is the expert's failure to correct for any potential explanatory variables other than age. Completely ignored was the more than remote possibility that age was correlated with a legitimate job-related qualification, such as familiarity with computers. Everyone knows that younger people are on average more comfortable with computers than older people are, just as older people are on average more comfortable with manual-shift cars than younger people are. Three weeks of training might go some distance toward closing the computer-literacy gap, yet it would be more surprising than otherwise if so short a period of training could close the gap completely. The expert could easily [**8] have inquired about the feasibility of ascertaining through discovery the history of the use of computers by each of the employees on the list of 17.

    "question": "Context: Mariner's [**21] explanation is not so convincing as to render Integra's explanation implausible at the pleading stage. Integra sought to control for, inter alia, the \"access to care available to the [SNF] patients\" sampled in its models through the use of county-level demographic variables (e.g., unemployment rate, percent of population without a high school diploma, log median income). See FAC ¶ 95 (Equation 1, Panels A and B). But even if Integra did not explicitly factor a more difficult locus of discharge into its regression model, the likelihood that locus of discharge would be the cause of the higher rate of UHR across all 58 principal diagnosis codes (with a sample size of over 13 million SNF admissions) is not so obvious as to render Integra's explanation implausible. Starr, 652 F.3d at 1216. Mariner has not pointed to any evidence that there are such significant differences in locus of discharge at Mariner and non-Mariner facilities. If such differences existed, one would expect that they would appear in the data and influence the UHR rates with respect to certain diagnosis codes, but Mariner has pointed to no such pattern. Cf.

    "question": "Context: Here, the scope and specificity of the plaintiffs' investigation and the alleged precision with which its proffered regression analysis can attribute the plaintiffs' injuries to the defendants' actions, provide plausible proximate cause.13 The statistical evidence offered, like the differential impact of the mobile home park's documentation policy in Reyes and the costs incurred by the tax base in City of Miami, is precisely the kind of statistical evidence of disparate effects that is cognizable under the FHA. The statistics and regression analyses presented in the complaint raise a fair inference of causation. While the defendants' critique of the investigation's composite variables also may have some merit, see NFHA v. U.S. Bank, N.A., No. 01-12-0283-8 (HUD Jan. 8, 2016), Bank of America Mot. Dismiss, Ex. 1, ECF No. 44-3, they do not defeat the well-pled factual contention that the defendants' delegation of its maintenance responsibilities—in the aggregate—caused disparate racial impact. The other factors considered in the City of Miami proximate [**39] cause calculus do not change this result. While the risk of additional plaintiffs and multiple recoveries may be marginally greater than that in City of Miami where the city was the only injured party, the risk is mitigated by the necessary investigative depth and statistical sophistication required to bring a disparate impact claim. See City of Miami, 923 F.3d 1286-87. By the same token, it is hard to imagine a plaintiff better situated to bring these claims than a group of the nation's, preeminent nonprofit fair housing organizations. See id. at 1288-89.

    "question": "Context: To explore a possible cause and effect relationship further study is required. The investigator should then observe the effect on one variable, the dependent variable, of manipulation of another, an independent variable. Id. at 348. Independent variables represent the possible \"causes\" of the \"effect\" being studied. If the study does not contemplate the results of manipulating various independent variables, it does little to prove causation. That is because the real cause of the observed results may be variables other than the one with which the dependent variable is associated. When an association is identified among variables, a controlled experiment will help identify which independent variable caused the effect. In fact, this is the best way to eliminate other variables as possible causes of observed associations. Id. at 347. If a controlled experiment [**31] is not conducted, then the investigator should at least measure the group in which the effect occurred against a comparable group in which the effect is not expected or observed. See id. at 349. The key to success, however, is that the second group actually be comparable. The statistics offered by the plaintiffs have only eliminated random chance as a possible explanation for the disparities. See Pls.' Ex. 56, Wertheimer Report at 8, PP 14, 16, 20-22, 28; Defs.' App. 108, Rothman Report at 4; see also EEOC v. Sears Roebuck & Co. 839 F.2d 302, 323 n.20 (7th Cir. 1988) (standard deviation and other measures of statistical [**43] significance merely attempt to eliminate chance as reason for results, do not prove causation). That method would be valid if it is reasonable to assume that the job skills the defendants needed to retain were equally distributed across age groups. See Barnes, 896 F.2d at 1466. If it is not reasonable so to assume, a defendant can show that the statistical method is faulty, or that chance does explain the discrepancy, and the statistical evidence may lose its effectiveness altogether. Id. at 1469.

Such a statistical significance means that there is a 5% probability that the difference found is due to chance rather than being caused by the studied process. Id. Here, Farber's regression analyses show statistical significance at the 5% level, so his studies indicates that there is a 5% chance that the residuals (i.e. the difference in treatment) result from something other than differences in the employee's gender. Farber Report ¶¶ 76, 79, 81-83, 98-102, 104-105, 134-135. The Court, therefore, finds that Farber can testify that the differences he found were based on gender.

    "question": "Context: Barak-Corren admits she can't explain why her survey suggests many more vendors would've been willing to serve same-sex couples than opposite-sex couples before Masterpiece, and what that means for the level of \"discrimination\" she infers before and after the Supreme Court's decision.

The City takes the opposite position. City Daubert Response at 13. Yet the study suggests as much. At least some of that disparity can be chalked up to its treatment of pre-Masterpiece non-responses as neutral but post-Masterpiece non-responses as discriminatory rejection. Post-Masterpiece, more vendors (75.5%) responded to opposite-sex requests than to inquiries from the fictitious same-sex couples (63.3%).

    "question": "Context: Within the Democratic Party, there is evidence that black Democrats get more votes in statewide appellate judicial races than white Democrats. Under a multivariate regression model in which the two independent variables are the percentage of registered voters who are African American and whether the losing candidate was African American, black Democratic candidates perform an average of 1.4 percentage points better than white Democratic candidates.44 Bonneau Expert Report, at 15, [*1292] ¶ 36 (Defs.'

    "question": "Context: The Court begins its analysis by first reviewing the endogenous elections. To understand Dr. Mayer's conclusions, it does well to first understand Dr. Mayer's methods. Dr. Mayer relied upon the data set provided by Mr. Ely—which combined surname and ACS data—to analyze endogenous and exogenous elections. Rather than employing an ecological regression analysis to estimate individual voting behavior from this data, Dr. Mayer relied on an ecological inference analysis. For the Court's purposes, this simply means that Dr. Mayer used a technique which recognizes that certain \"statistical assumptions underlying regression analysis do not hold when one has aggregate data rather than individual data . . . .\" (Defendants' [**132] Exhibit 1). Dr. Alford agrees that ecological inference techniques \"use the available data in a more efficient way and so provide estimates of the relationship between the size of demographic groups and candidate support that are potentially less biased and more certain than previous methods\" (Defendants' Exhibit 1). Thus, the Court need not question the reliability of Dr. Mayer's methods. In the end, Dr. Mayer simply used a more reliable method for estimating the voting behavior of subgroups in the relevant electorate in FISD.

The Court finds that the statistical evidence presented, in combination with the other circumstantial evidence (e.g., that Muslim employees' use of unscheduled breaks to pray was targeted for discipline), is sufficient for the Court to infer a pattern or practice of discriminatory discipline on the basis of black race and Muslim religion during Ramadan 2008.

In order to utilize this correlation to establish a violation of the Fair Housing Act on the part of a private landlord, plaintiffs would have to show that there existed some demonstrable prejudicial treatment of minorities over and above that which is the inevitable result of disparity in income.

Her comments in [*50] December 2016 took place three months before her March 2017 interview for the RCM1 position at Riverbank Athletics in March 2017, and Champion's 2017 comments were made during the interview itself. The same, however, cannot be said regarding her 2014 comments. Even if Champion could establish that her comments constitute protected activity, her claim—to the extent based on her 2014 comments—would not establish the causal connection required to make out a prima facie case. HN21 Causal connection can be demonstrated either \"directly, through evidence of retaliatory animus directed against the plaintiff by the defendant,\" or \"indirectly, by showing that the protected activity was followed closely by the discriminatory treatment.\" Hicks, 593 F.3d at 170 (quoting Gordon v.

Champion has not identified any direct evidence of a causal connection between any of her four sets of comments and adverse employment action. Rather, she relies on the temporal proximity between her comments and Parks' decisions not to promote her.

The County contends that the \"termination memorandum\" issued in conjunction with Dreibelbis' termination on June 21, 2018, which is attached to the Complaint, \"clearly\" shows that she was terminated because \"she failed to comply with the County's Time and Attendance Policy by accumulating an excessive number of unexcused absences.\" County's Memorandum in Support of its Motion (\"County's Mem.\") [ECF No. 6-1] at 8.

Compl. ¶¶ 152, 154.

See Pye, 641 F.3d 1019 (explaining that to be similarly situated employees must be \"involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct and . . . disciplined in different ways\" (cleaned up) (quoting Wimbley v. Cashion, 588 F.3d 959, 962 (8th Cir. 2009))). The record shows that the first of the three Assistant Front Office Managers Atrium hired was a former Atrium employee with a great track record at the company who had left to attend hospitality school. The second had an undergraduate degree in event management. And the third served as a Night Auditor at another hotel for five years, which both parties acknowledge represents management experience. In contrast, Carter had no formal hospitality or event management education, lacked management experience, and received a number of disciplinary write-ups from Atrium before being passed over [**13] for promotion. In addition, the record shows that Atrium has hired Black men for the Assistant Front Office Manager position in the past. Even drawing all reasonable inferences in Carter's favor, after a careful review of the record we conclude that he has not presented evidence to show that Atrium's stated reason for declining to promote him was \"not the true reason,\" but rather a \"pretext for discrimination.\" Kim v. Nash Finch Co., 123 F.3d 1046, 1056 (8th Cir. 1997) (quoting Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affs. v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)).

Under the third prong of the pleading standard, Plaintiff was required to provide sufficient factual allegations to support a plausible inference of race discrimination. The Amended [*16] Complaint, however, is devoid of any such factual material. Although she alleges that she was repeatedly mistreated by her supervisors, ECF No. 17-2 at 3-9, there are no facts alleged from which it can be plausibly inferred that the mistreatment was racially motivated. While the Amended Complaint generally avers that \"[s]imilarly situated co-workers outside of the [her] race were not treated in the manner in which [she] was,\" id. at 9, Plaintiff offers no facts to back that up, rendering the allegation \"just a legal conclusion—and a legal conclusion is never enough.\" SS & T, LLC v.

Indeed, nowhere does the Amended Complaint even generally describe any comparator employees, how they were similarly situated, or how they were treated differently than Plaintiff. Other courts in this [*17] District and elsewhere have not hesitated to dismiss disparate treatment Title VII claims with comparable pleading deficiencies. See, e.g., Beaulieu v.

However, Sosa makes no mention of who these other teachers were, how their requests were similar to hers, or any other facts that would elevate her allegation beyond that of a \"naked assertion.\" See, e.g., Stinnett v.

    "question": "Context: Wills hasn't identified a single similarly-situated comparator. See MSJ Response at 8-10. He doesn't, for example, offer up a white store manager—or, for that matter, any other employee—who yelled at several coworkers (sometimes in front of customers) while throwing merchandise and who, despite this misconduct, wasn't fired. In fact, the record supports the exact opposite conclusion. As Schiller, the ethics case manager, testified: \"[T]he determination was made to terminate Marcellus based on his pattern of harassing and intimidating behavior in his store. And that termination is very consistent with [*1246] how we would treat other store managers who behaved the same way.\" Schiller Depo. at 51:7-11 (emphasis added). Despite having over nine months to develop the factual record in this case, Wills hasn't adduced a single piece of evidence to rebut this proposition.

That the plaintiff did not pursue arbitration constitutes a major difference. Chief Pavlik attests that under his watch no officers, who were previously terminated, were reinstated unless he was ordered to do so by an arbitrator. Plaintiff argues that the \"union let [his] case fall by the wayside.\" ECF No. 24-2, pg. 13. But [*82] even if true, that has no bearing on this analysis. The plaintiff's claims allege that WMATA officials treated him disparately from other officers by not reinstating him, not that his union representatives treated him poorly.

    "question": "Context: But Plaintiff's argument [**44] does not extend beyond the prima facie stage. Plaintiff has not argued that Defendant lacked legitimate business reasons for the 2015 raise, the 2015 RIF ratings, or the subsequent termination. Likewise, Plaintiff has not argued that Defendant's stated reasons were a pretext for retaliation. Conversely, Defendant has established that it gave similar raises to similarly situated employees, honestly rated Plaintiff's job competencies in the 2015 RIF, and non-discriminatorily selected to terminate Plaintiff's employment. Plaintiff presents no evidence that Defendant's actions were actually driven by retaliatory intent. Instead, Plaintiff appears to rely on the same actions he argues establish pretext for intentional race and national origin discrimination. But the Court has already rejected those arguments as insufficient to establish pretext for Plaintiff's discrimination claims and they similarly fail with regard to his retaliation claims. Ultimately, a reasonable jury could not find in Plaintiff's favor. See Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L.

    "question": "Context: To summarize, in the period covered by the complaint, Infosys employed 46,979 workers in 134,113 roles in the United States. Compared to the relevant labor market, the Infosys workforce was composed of a remarkably disproportionate share of South Asians, and similarly a remarkably disproportionate share of Indians (a slightly narrower group than South Asians). Across the different analyses this report covers, these percentages were approximately 89%, [*27] versus about 11%-20% in the relevant labor market. Infosys hires were also disproportionately South Asian or Indian to a remarkable degree—approximately 75%, versus approximately 11%-20% of employees in the relevant labor market. The applicants to Infosys were also highly disproportionately South Asian or Indian. Despite an employment share of about 11%-20% South Asian or Indian in the relevant labor market, Infosys' applicants were around 45% South Asian or Indian. And even when it received applicants who were not South Asian or Indian, Infosys was more likely to offer jobs to applicants who were South Asian or Indian. The apparent favorable treatment of South Asians or Indians continued once employment commenced. Promotion rates for South Asian or Indian employees were about 58%, compared to around 21% for non-South Asian or non-Indian employees. Separation rates of non-South Asian or non-Indian employees were much higher—approximately 51% versus 8%—and in particular the rate of company-initiated separations was double for non-South Asians or non-Indians—about 23% versus 11% for South Asians or Indians. Along all of these dimensions I have examined, the statistical evidence is strongly [*28] consistent with Infosys discriminating against non-South Asians and non-Indians in hiring, recruitment, promotions, and terminations.
