    "question": "Jill: State funding has been recommended to encourage the automobile industry to create vehicles that will better withstand collisions. Unless new vehicles are made that can better withstand collisions, highway safety cannot be improved. The automobile industry does not have the funds to conduct the research needed to produce vehicles that are better equipped to withstand collisions. Hence, without this state funding, the safety of drivers is compromised.

Ttherefore, the state' s highways will be safer even without the state funding this research for the automobile industry.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption on which Mark's argument depends?\nOptions: ['Drivers realize that driving at excessive speeds is the main cause of collisions on highways.', 'The state has the financial means to install more highway patrol forces and give funding to the automobile industry.', 'The cost to install more highway patrol forces will be less than the amount of funding that would be given to the automobile industry.', 'The increased presence of the highway patrol will not itself somehow cause more accidents than it prevents.']",

    "question": "Some plants have extremely sensitive biological thermometers. For example, the leaves of rhododendrons curl when the temperature of the air around them is below 0 degree C (Celsius). Similarly, mature crocus blossoms open in temperatures above 2 degree C. So someone who simultaneously observed rhododendrons with uncurled leaves, crocuses with mature but unopened blossoms, and a thermometer showing 1 degree C could determine that the thermometer' s reading was accurate to within plus or minus 1 degree C.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the reasoning above?\nOptions: ['Certain types of thermometers that are commonly used to measure outdoor temperatures can be extremely accurate in moderate temperature ranges but much less accurate in warmer or colder temperature ranges.', 'The climate and soil conditions that favor the growth of rhododendrons are also favorable to the growth of crocuses.', 'Neither rhododendrons nor crocuses bloom for more than a few weeks each year, and the blossoms of rhododendrons growing in any area do not appear until at least several weeks after crocuses growing in that area have ceased to bloom.', 'Air temperature surrounding rhododendrons, which can grow 12 feet tall, is likely to differ from air temperature surrounding crocuses, which are normally only a few inches high, by more than 2 degree C, even if the two plants are growing side by side.']",
    "answer": "3, \"Air temperature surrounding rhododendrons, which can grow 12 feet tall, is likely to differ from air temperature surrounding crocuses, which are normally only a few inches high, by more than 2 degree C, even if the two plants are growing side by side.\""

    "question": "It is difficult to keep deep wounds free of bacteria. Even strong antibiotics fail to kill the bacteria that live in such wounds. However, many physicians have succeeded in eliminating bacteria from deep wounds by packing the wound with a sweet substance like sugar.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why treating deep wounds with sugar as described above is successful?\nOptions: ['Sugar that is nearly pure is readily available for use in medical treatments.', 'Many kinds of bacteria can use sugar as a nutrient and will reproduce rapidly when sugar is available to them.', 'Bacteria that live in deep wounds thrive in a moist environment, and sugar has a dehydrating effect.', 'Some foods that contain sugar can weaken the effects of certain antibiotics.']",

    "question": "Psychologist: Psychotherapists who attempt to provide psychotherapy on radio or television talk shows are expected to do so in ways that entertain a broad audience. However, satisfying this demand is nearly always incompatible with providing high-quality psychological help. For this reason, psychotherapists should never provide psychotherapy on talk shows.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles must be assumed in order for the psychologist's conclusion to be properly drawn?\nOptions: ['Psychotherapists should never attempt to provide psychological help in a manner that makes it unlikely to be of high quality.', 'Most members of radio and television talk show audiences are seeking entertainment rather than high-quality psychological help.', 'Psychotherapy should never be provided in a context in which there is any chance that the therapy might be of less than high quality.', 'It is never appropriate for psychotherapists to attempt to entertain a broad audience.']",

    "question": "In the next decade, a large percentage of municipalities throughout the country will experience power failures if they do not modernize their electrical substations. The vast majority of substations in the country already handle currents between 60% and 80% of their maximum capacity, and currents are expected to rise, perhaps by as much as a factor of 3 in the next decade, because of population increase and the increased demand from both industry and electronics in individual homes.\nQuestion: Which of the following is an assumption of the above argument?\nOptions: ['An electrical substation fails when the current it handles rises above its maximum capacity.', 'Ten years from now, the average household will own a greater number of electronic devices than does the average household today.', 'A modernized electric substation would be able to handle at least three times the amount of current as does a current substation.', \"Many electrical substations in operation today are old, and have several aged components that could break down, leading to power failures, even if current levels don't increase substantially.\"]",

    "question": "It is not known whether bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), a disease of cattle invariably deadly to them, can be transmitted directly from one infected animal to another at all stages of the infection. If it can be, there is now a reservoir of infected cattle incubating the disease. There are no diagnostic tests to identify infected animals before the animals show overt symptoms. Ttherefore, if such direct transmission occurs, the disease cannot be eradicated by __.\nQuestion: Which one of the following best completes the argument?\nOptions: ['destroying all cattle in areas where BSE occurs and raising cattle only in areas to which BSE is known not to have spread', 'developing a drug that kills the agent that causes BSE, and then treating with that drug all cattle that might have the disease', 'removing from the herd and destroying any diseased animal as soon as it shows the typical symptoms of advanced BSE', 'developing a vaccine that confers lifelong immunity against BSE and giving it to all cattle, destroying in due course all those animals for which the vaccine protection came too late']",
