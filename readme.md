# CausalRL: Causal-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO)

This repository contains the official implementation of **Causal-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO)**. 

CE-PO is a model-agnostic reward fusion framework designed to mitigate "shortcut learning" in Large Language Models (LLMs). It augments standard policy optimization (PPO/GRPO) by combining task accuracy rewards with **Jacobian-based causal coherence signals**. [cite_start]This ensures that the model's reasoning pathway ($Z \rightarrow X \rightarrow Y$) is not only accurate but faithful

## 📂 Project Structure

[cite_start]The project is organized to separate the causal reward calculation from the policy optimization loop, leveraging the **Verl** framework[cite: 356].

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

The code relies on the **Verl** framework for efficient RLHF training. Ensure your environment is set up with Python 3.11+.

### 1. Activate Jacobian Reward Calculation

CE-PO requires differentiable, model-internal proxies for causal coherence. You must first compute these signals or run the reward server thread.

```bash
cd reward_part
bash run.sh

```

This step computes the raw Jacobian sensitivities and applies **counterfactual hardening** to remove nuisance factors (e.g., length biases).

### 2. Run Policy Optimization (CE-PO)

Once the reward signals are available, run the training script. The trainer uses a **Minkowski (power-mean) combiner** to fuse the accuracy reward (e.g., BERTScore) with the causal signals.

```bash
cd ..
bash trainer/llama38.sh

```

> 
> **Note:** The training uses **PPO** or **GRPO** (Group Relative Policy Optimization) as the underlying RL algorithm.

## Parallel Computing Implementation

A critical implementation detail of CausalRL is the handling of computational overhead. Calculating Jacobian matrices for every token generation is computationally intensive.

To address this, this implementation modifies the base **Verl** framework to utilize a **separate thread for reward calculation**.

* **Main Thread:** Handles the policy optimization (actor/critic updates).
* 
**Reward Thread:** Asynchronously computes the Jacobian-based causal influence scores (, ) and performs the spectral energy normalization.
