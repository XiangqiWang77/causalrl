These markers are reserved for art instructors to use during class activities, while parents and their children are encouraged to bring their own materials. Art instructors often borrow markers as part of the lessons, but parents sometimes help themselves despite the rules. Notices are posted around the room explaining that the markers are meant only for instructors. On a busy Saturday morning, during a craft session, one of the instructors takes markers from the table to set up a coloring station. At the same time, a parent sneaks a marker from the container to give to their child.
